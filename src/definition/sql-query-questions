What is Database?
A. It is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system

What is DBMS?
A. Database management system (DBMS) is a software package designed to define, manipulate, retrieve and manage data in
a database. A DBMS generally manipulates the data itself, the data format, field names, record and file structure.

What is the difference between SQL and MySQL?
A. SQL is used in the accessing, updating, and manipulation of data in a database
while MySQL is an RDBMS that allows keeping the data that exists in a database organized.
SQL is a Structured Query Language and MySQL is a RDBMS to store, retrieve, modify and administrate a database

What is RDBMS? How is it different from DBMS?
A. Key Difference between DBMS and RDBMS is that RDBMS (relational database management system) applications store data
in a tabular form, while DBMS applications store data as files.

What are Tables and Fields?
A. A table is a data structure where data can be organized in fields (columns) & records (rows).
For example, information of the employees of an organization needs to be stored. A record represents a set of related
data. A complete set of values for all columns/field is called record or row.

What is SQL?
A. Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database.

What are Constraints in SQL?
A. Constraints are the rules enforced on the data columns of a table. These are used to limit the type of data that
can go into a table.

What is a Primary Key?
A. Primary key is an existing table column or a column that is specifically generated by the database according to a
defined sequence.

What is a Foreign Key?
A. A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between
data in two tables

What is Normalization?
A. The process of reducing the duplication of the data.

What is Denormalization?
A. Is a strategy that database managers use to increase the performance of a database infrastructure.
It involves adding redundant data to a normalized database to reduce certain types of problems with database queries
that combine data from various tables into a single table.
